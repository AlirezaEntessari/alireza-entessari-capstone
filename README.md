# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

My app is a travel app designed to give potential travellers access to relevant information regarding different countries and travel destinations.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Many people who are travelling do not have access to pertinent safety information and other logistical information. 

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

The people who will use my app are people interested in traveling.  

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

The functionality that my app will include is that there will be different routes configured for different countries.  There will be multiple carousels to display different types of information in carousel format.  There will also be a page to display weather information for the different countries.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

The technologies that will be used in my app will be react, react-router-dom, node, and express.  

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

The external sources of data that will be used in my app include the Spoonacular API, https://spoonacular.com/food-api.  This API will be used for the recipe data that relates to each of the different countries.  I will also use a weather API and a currency API to list the currencies and conversion rates for the different countries.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

One page will be the front page.  There will be a menu on the frontpage with links to the different countries.  There will be separate pages and URLs for the different countries.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out. 

A lot of the data will be retrieved using APIs.  If it is not possible to retrieve an image or another piece of information using an API, I will hardcode it in the code.

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

The HTTP endpoints that my server will implement will include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

My project will utilize Auth0 for authentication purposes.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

By Thanksgiving I will try to have my routes and the carousels configured.  By Saturday, November 25, I will try to have at least 5 different country pages completed.  I will list the most popular countries and destinations. By next Monday I hope to have my prototype configured.  

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.

Additional features I may complete if I have extra time is animations for the pages.
