# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

My app is a learning app designed to teach users the fundamentals of software development.  They will have access to PowerPoints and quizzes intended for them to increase their knowledge and skill level.  

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

My app is needed as many people pursuing a career in software development do not know the fundamentals.  The app is intended to make the transition to software development more seamless and efficient.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

The people who will use my app are individuals interested in a career in software development.  They will use the app on a daily basis to further their software knowledge.  The special considerations I will take into account are to design the app for people of different skill levels.  People at a more beginner level will have a different course progression than individuals with more advanced skills.  I will also have subtitle capability designed for the app to assist individuals who are hearing impaired.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

The functionality that my app will include is that there will be quizzes to improve the user's knowledge of software development.  There will also be PowerPoints and lectures to help the student in their software development journey.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

The technologies that will be used in my app will be react, react-router-dom, node, and express.  

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

The external sources of data that will be used in my app are this api, https://quizapi.io/.  I will use this api to bring in the data that is going to be used for my quiz functionality.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

One page will be the welcome page.  Other pages will be related to the level of the user: beginner, intermediate, or advanced.  There will also be additional pages related to each of the quizzes and PowerPoints/

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out. 

The data will be retrieved using an API.  I will also hardcode the quiz prompts and style the pages using scss.

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

The HTTP endpoints that my server will implement will include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

My project will utilize Auth0 for authentication purposes.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

I will try to have my project ready by demo day.

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.

Additional features I may complete if I have extra time is animations for the pages.
